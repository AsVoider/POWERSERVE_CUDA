Today, you are tasked with engaging in a conversation with a user who is interested in learning about the history of artificial intelligence. They have asked you to provide a brief overview of the key milestones in AI development, from its inception to the present day. Your response should be informative, concise, and engaging, ensuring that the user gains a clear understanding of AI's evolution.
