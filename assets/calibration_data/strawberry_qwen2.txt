So I have this question: "How many 'r's' in 'strawberry'?" It seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I'm answering it correctly. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to identify the word in question, which is "strawberry." Okay, that's clear. Now, I need to count how many times the letter 'r' appears within that word.

Let's write out the word: s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y.

Now, I'll go through each letter and see if it's an 'r':

- s: not an 'r'

- t: not an 'r'

- r: that's an 'r'

- a: not an 'r'

- w: not an 'r'

- b: not an 'r'

- e: not an 'r'

- r: another 'r'

- r: yet another 'r'

- y: not an 'r'

So, in total, there are three 'r's' in the word "strawberry."

Wait a minute, let me double-check that. Sometimes I might miss a letter. Let's count them again:

1. The first 'r' is in "strawberry" right after the 'a'.

2. The second 'r' is right before the last 'y'.

3. The third 'r' is at the end of the word.

Yes, that's three 'r's'. I think that's the correct answer.

But just to be thorough, maybe I should consider if there are any other 'r's' that I might have overlooked. For example, is there an 'r' in "strawberry" that's not immediately visible? No, I don't think so. The word is fairly straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me, and there's a hidden 'r' somewhere. But that seems unlikely. In standard English, "strawberry" only has three 'r's'.

So, I'm confident that the answer is three.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{3} \]<|im_end|>
