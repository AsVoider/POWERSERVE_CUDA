Mia is planning a camping trip in the Canadian Rockies and has a budget of $800 for equipment. She buys a tent for $120, which is 15% off the original price. She then purchases a sleeping bag for $80, which is 20% off. If she also needs to buy a backpack and a portable stove, and the total cost of these two items is $180, what percentage of her budget will she have left after all the purchases?
